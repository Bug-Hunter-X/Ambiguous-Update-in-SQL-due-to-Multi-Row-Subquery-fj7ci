The issue can be solved by modifying the query to ensure that the subquery returns only one row for each update.  Several methods exist to achieve this:

**Method 1: Using a JOIN**

This approach joins the table with an aggregate subquery that calculates the average salary for the 'Sales' department. This ensures only one average salary is used for the update.

```sql
UPDATE employees AS e
JOIN (SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales') AS avg
SET e.salary = avg.avg_salary
WHERE e.department = 'Marketing';
```

**Method 2:  Using a correlated subquery (if you need different averages for different rows)**

If you need a different average value calculated for each Marketing employee based on a specific criteria, a correlated subquery is more suitable,  but ensure it will not return multiple rows per main table row.

```sql
-- Example: updating salary based on a specific criteria
UPDATE employees e
SET salary = (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' AND some_condition = e.some_condition)
WHERE department = 'Marketing';
```

**Important:** Choose the method that best aligns with the desired update logic and database structure. Always ensure that the subquery's result set aligns correctly to the number of rows expected in the update.

Note that the `some_condition` part is for illustrative purposes. Adjust it as required to correctly match criteria between departments.
