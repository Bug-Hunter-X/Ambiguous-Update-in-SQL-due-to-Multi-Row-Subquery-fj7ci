This repository demonstrates a common SQL error that occurs when using subqueries in UPDATE statements. The `bug.sql` file contains a query that attempts to update multiple rows based on a subquery returning more than one row, leading to an error. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.sql`, addresses this by using a different approach that ensures only one value is assigned for each update.
